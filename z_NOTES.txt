<NOTES>: 
- come up with a way to differentiate pure coflow logic + stuff that is used to make the code work in user space 
  - can use VSCode's file diff (red + green)
  - can look at commented out code
- need more (useful) test cases

<QUESTIONS>:
- ith I can give a custom property/member named "flowName" to struct fq_flow so that I can use this to print out flow names
- maybe a utility func that prints the entire flows list with property details
  - vertical direction for printing the flows, and indentations for printing out flow properties (socket_hash of the flow)
- another utility func that prints out the entire flow, given a flow name 
  - not sure what to print, maybe the tstamp?

<ISSUES>:
- u32 pFlowid[2] = {-1, -1}; -> I used {5, 1111}
  - Result: "time_next_packet: 1666137344" for one of the packets -> this is not from any of my custom tstamps
  - Result: all flow lists are empty (even the coflows list)
  - Q: is this due to Promotecoflows()? some weird things happen when valuePresentInArray() returns true
