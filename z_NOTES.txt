<NOTES>: 
- come up with a way to differentiate pure coflow logic + stuff that is used to make the code work in user space 
  - can use VSCode's file diff (red + green)
  - can look at commented out code
- need more (useful) test cases
- (HEON:TODO - ... ) => search for these comment blocks to find the most recent places I've worked on

<ISSUES>:
- 

<QUESTIONS>:
- unlikely(skb->sk == sk && f->socket_hash != sk->sk_hash)
  - what exactly is unlikely? 
  - (skb->sk == sk && f->socket_hash != sk->sk_hash):
    - was 0, and unlikely(0) was 0 -> shouldn't it be 1?
    - what condition is this checking exactly?
  

<make command for "json-c" library>:
gcc main.c -I /common/home/hy368/Desktop/Research/json-c-build/  -l json-c -o main

<TODO>: 
- plfowid logic needs to be there for the new flows as well, not only the old flows (inside fq classify)
- (pretty sure) the commented out part in fq_classify regarding pflowid needs to be uncommented for coflow logic
