<QUESTIONS>:
- ith I can give a custom property/member named "flowName" to struct fq_flow so that I can use this to print out flow names
- maybe a utility func that prints the entire flows list with property details
  - vertical direction for printing the flows, and indentations for printing out flow properties (socket_hash of the flow)
- another utility func that prints out the entire flow, given a flow name 
  - not sure what to print, maybe the tstamp?
